# mclient

Pinect console SMTP command client on GitHub.
This is a powerful and easy-to-use client designed specifically for the Pinect console, 
allowing for remote management and control via common mail messages sent through the SMTP protocol.

This client allows the server to send commands to the Pinect console via a common mail message from the mail server.
The client then receives the message and processes the command, providing a simple and efficient way for the server to communicate with the Pinect console.

The client is built using standard SMTP protocol,
making it easy to integrate with existing mail servers and infrastructure. 
It is a useful tool for remote management, automation, and control of the Pinect console,
ensuring that it remains secure and compliant with the latest policies and regulations.
